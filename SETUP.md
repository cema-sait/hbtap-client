# HTA Frontend Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the HTA Frontend app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### 1. Node.js 18+
- **Download:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Verify installation:**
  ```bash
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```

### 2. PM2 (Process Manager)
PM2 is required for running the Next.js application in production mode.

**Installation:**
```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
pm2 --version
```

## Environment Configuration

### Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root directory with the following configuration:

```properties
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

**Note:** This URL should point to your HTA Server backend API.
---

## Setup Process

### 1. Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd hta
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages listed in `package.json`.

### 3. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build of your Next.js application.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

For development with hot-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
